                                            Like any field, developing new technologies tends to be quite costly,
                                            more so in the case of gaming technologies. Our project holds the potential
                                            to completely revolutionize the gaming industry, which is where you, as an
                                            individual, come into play. CrowdFunding is our best shot at making this project see the daylight,
                                            without the risk of it being shutoff midway due to heavy interest rates from banks.
                                            And rest assured, we have set donation goals, and tiers, and each person who meets the criteria for
                                            a certain tier will get the tier reward, which you can learn more about in our Rewards section.
